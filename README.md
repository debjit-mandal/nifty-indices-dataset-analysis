# NIFTY Indices Analysis

This repository contains various Jupyter Notebooks analyzing NIFTY indices data. The analyses include financial metrics, volume and turnover trends, sector performance, correlation between indices, and time series forecasting.

## Notebooks

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzes the underlying patterns, trends, and distributions in the NIFTY indices data.
   - [EDA_NIFTY_Indices_Corrected.ipynb](link-to-notebook)

2. **Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA**
   - Demonstrates time series forecasting using the ARIMA model on NIFTY indices data.
   - [ARIMA_Forecasting_NIFTY_Indices.ipynb](link-to-notebook)

3. **Machine Learning Models for Prediction**
   - Explores machine learning models (e.g., LSTM) for predicting future values of the indices.
   - [LSTM_Prediction_NIFTY_Indices.ipynb](link-to-notebook)

4. **Financial Metrics Analysis**
   - Deep dive into financial metrics and their implications on stock indices.
   - [Financial_Metrics_Analysis_NIFTY_Indices.ipynb](link-to-notebook)

5. **Volume and Turnover Analysis**
   - Analyzes volume and turnover trends to understand market activity.
   - [Volume_Turnover_Analysis_NIFTY_Indices.ipynb](link-to-notebook)

6. **Sector-wise Performance Analysis**
   - Compares the performance of different sectors (e.g., Auto, IT, FMCG).
